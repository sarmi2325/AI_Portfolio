Projects
Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection using Ensemble Deep Learning & Grad-CAM
The goal of this project was to develop a robust AI system capable of classifying chest X-ray images into NORMAL or
PNEUMONIA using deep learning, with a strong emphasis on both accuracy and interpretability. Recognizing the
challenges posed by a relatively small medical imaging dataset, we leveraged transfer learning with pretrained models
like EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and a custom CNN architecture. These models were fine-tuned selectively to avoid
overfitting, and performance was enhanced using data augmentation, dropout layers, and careful freezing of earlier
layers. Among the architectures, EfficientNetB0 consistently offered the best balance between performance and
efficiency.
efficiency.
To improve the reliability and generalizability of predictions, we implemented a confidence-based weighted ensemble
method. Instead of simple averaging or majority voting, each model's output was weighted according to its confidence
for the given image, resulting in a more balanced and sample-specific prediction. This ensemble outperformed individual
models, achieving an accuracy of 94.71% and an impressive AUC of 0.9874. We also integrated Grad-CAM
visualizations into the system to provide transparent, human-understandable insights into how the model arrived at its
decisions—crucial for clinical trust and adoption. Grad-CAM heatmaps were dynamically generated from the top
convolutional layers, highlighting lung regions that influenced the classification.
The final system was deployed using Streamlit Cloud, providing a real-time web interface where users can upload X-
ray images and receive predictions with Grad-CAM explanations. The interface features color-coded sections, side-by-
side model outputs, ensemble confidence bars, and clearly separated predictions from individual models. This
combination of high-performing deep learning, explainability via Grad-CAM, and accessible deployment ensures the
system is not only accurate but also trustworthy and usable—meeting both technical rigor and real-world medical AI
expectations.
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
The objective of this project was to build a robust, interpretable, and deployable machine learning system for predicting
customer churn in the telecom industry. The focus was on maximizing recall for churners while maintaining balanced
accuracy. To establish strong baselines, I initially explored linear models including Logistic Regression (LR), Support
Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. Among these, Logistic Regression with L2
regularization emerged as the most effective, achieving an AUC of approximately 0.83 with strong recall for churn
prediction. However, given the class imbalance in the dataset, I employed SMOTE Tomek, a hybrid sampling strategy
combining oversampling and undersampling, to improve model fairness and generalization—especially critical for
churner detection.
Moving beyond linear models, I evaluated several tree-based and boosting methods to capture complex feature
interactions and nonlinearities. While Random Forests and Extra Trees performed reliably (with Random Forest
reaching an AUC of ~0.84), I aimed to further optimize performance using gradient boosting. Among the boosting
techniques tested, LightGBM stood out, delivering the best combination of speed and predictive accuracy (AUC
~0.85). Its native support for SHAP values made it ideal for model explainability. This was a key factor in its selection,
as interpretability is essential in customer-facing business applications. I incorporated SHAP to visualize feature
influence on individual predictions, giving stakeholders clear insights into why a customer is at risk of churning.
The final solution employed a stacked ensemble model with Logistic Regression and LightGBM as base learners, and
Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. This hybrid architecture improved stability, bias-variance trade-off, and
ultimately boosted churn detection accuracy. The ensemble achieved 79% overall accuracy with an AUC of 0.834. For
deployment, I built a user-friendly Streamlit app featuring manual and batch CSV input modes, an adjustable churn
threshold, and downloadable predictions. With integrated SHAP explainability and clear probability outputs, the system
provides actionable insights while remaining transparent and accessible—making it a powerful tool for enterprise-level
churn management.
Linear Algebra Visual Toolkit
Linear Algebra Visual Toolkit
The project aimed to create an interactive educational toolkit to help students and beginners understand core linear
algebra concepts such as solving linear systems, visualizing matrix transformations, and exploring Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). Built using NumPy for computations and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations, the app focuses on
offering a hands-on experience with intuitive, real-time feedback. It features three main modules: a Gaussian
Elimination Solver that guides users through forward and backward substitution steps; a Matrix Transformation
Visualizer that allows manipulation of 2D and 3D vectors; and a PCA Visualizer, built from scratch, that walks users
through covariance matrix calculation, eigen decomposition, and data projection onto principal components.
During development, several techniques evolved or were abandoned to prioritize clarity and performance. Matplotlib’s
3D plotting was replaced with optimized 2D visuals due to lag issues in Streamlit. Scikit-learn’s built-in PCA was
initially used but later swapped for a manual implementation to enhance educational value. Attempts to automate
equation parsing with SymPy were scrapped in favor of matrix-based manual input, reinforcing the project’s focus on
foundational learning. Challenges like displaying matrix steps clearly and visualizing 3D transformations in a compact
interface were tackled using LaTeX-style Markdown rendering and optional 2D/3D toggles.
The final product is modularized into three distinct pages within a Streamlit app: a Linear Systems Solver, a Matrix
Transformation tool, and a PCA Explorer. Features include a matrix builder UI with dynamic sliders, interactive vector
inputs, transformation animations, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction with eigenvalue explanations. Users can
upload datasets, visualize principal components, select top-k projections, and download the reduced data as CSV.
Deployed via Streamlit Cloud, the app is fully accessible online, enabling users to engage with linear algebra concepts
through an intuitive and educational interface.
