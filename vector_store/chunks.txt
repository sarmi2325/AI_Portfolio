Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning Ensemble

Developed and deployed a real-time AI system that classifies chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA using an ensemble of MobileNetV2 (distilled) and EfficientNetB0 models. The project integrates model explainability and user interaction through Grad-CAM and Streamlit.

• Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 (from ResNet50) and EfficientNetB0 with data augmentation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.  
• Implemented a confidence-based weighted ensemble strategy to enhance robustness over individual model predictions.  
• Integrated Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight model attention regions on X-rays, improving interpretability and clinical trust.  
• Achieved 94.71% accuracy, 0.94 F1-score, and AUC of 0.9918 on the test set with confusion matrix: [[262 31], [4 289]]  
• Deployed as a responsive Streamlit app allowing image uploads, side-by-side Grad-CAMs, and model-wise + ensemble predictions.

Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Built a robust, interpretable machine learning system to predict telecom customer churn using tabular data. The goal was to maximize recall for churners and overall model transparency.

• Explored baseline models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes. Tuned Logistic Regression with L2 regularization to achieve AUC ~0.83.  
• Applied SMOTE Tomek (oversampling + undersampling) to balance class distribution.  
• Trained tree-based models like Random Forest (AUC ~0.84) and boosting models (LightGBM: AUC ~0.85).  
• Final model: Stacking Ensemble with Logistic Regression + LightGBM, achieving 79% accuracy and AUC of 0.834.  
• Deployed a Streamlit app with CSV upload, churn threshold slider, SHAP explainability, and result download features.

Linear Algebra Visual Toolkit

An interactive educational tool to visualize key linear algebra concepts like Gaussian elimination, matrix transformation, and PCA.

• Designed three core visual modules: linear system solver, 2D/3D matrix transformation viewer, and PCA explorer with eigen decomposition from scratch.  
• Used NumPy, Matplotlib, and Streamlit to create visual workflows with sliders, file uploads, and step-by-step math explanations.  
• Built LaTeX-style matrix previews and vector visualizers with animation and interactive control.  
• PCA implemented from scratch using covariance matrix and eigen decomposition (no scikit-learn PCA).  
• Deployed via Streamlit Cloud with CSV input/output support.
